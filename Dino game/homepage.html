    <p class="desc-1">Introducing a Clone of Dino Game which is created by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>
      Dino Game is an endless runner game originally built into Google Chrome. <br><br>
      The game was added as an easter egg to Google Chrome in 2014 to entertain users when there is no internet 
      available.<br>
      This game featuring a t-rex is played by over 270 million players every month.<br>
      However, our Clone Dino game will have some extra features which were not included in the original version
      making it more appealing.<br><br>Some of those features are:-<br>--Players can sign-up and login to save their
      progress.<br>--Players can compete for the leaderboards to see who has the highest score.</p>
